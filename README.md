  Added ToolBar and updated formatting of list.
  Ability to delete items via long-click is now working.

  Updated keyboard so it wouldn't pop-up every time the app is opened.
  Now when the 'enter' button is clicked, an item is added to the list and the keyboard closes. Removed 'submit button'.
  Added SQLite backend so now data is saved. CRUD operations work with UI properly.
